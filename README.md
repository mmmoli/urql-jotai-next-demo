# urql-jotai-next-demo

OMG this took a while.
I wanted a way for [Jotai](https://jotai.org/), [Urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) and [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) to all get along.

The objective was to render server-side (SSR) and fallback to `atoms` if I forget anything.

Anyway, it works!
